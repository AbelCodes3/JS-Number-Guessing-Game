# JS-Number-Guessing-Game

Beginner level web-based JavaScript number guessing game. Built by a beginner looking to find a passion for software developing.

The game is very simple. The user must guess the randomly generated number by the application from 1 through 10. 

Everytime the user guesses a number the application will compare it to the randomly generated number and give feedback to the user such as "Too high, try again", "Too low, try again", and "Correct! You guessed the number".

Technologies Used: HTML, JavaScript

What I've learned: How to handle user input, How to use variables and conditional logic, How to update the page using JavaScript.
